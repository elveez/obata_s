<p>Hi. I&#8217;m a starter theme called <code>obata_s</code>, or <code>obatascores</code>, if you like. I&#8217;m a theme meant for hacking so don&#8217;t use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for.</p>

<p>My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you&#8217;re designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you&#8217;ll find here:</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
